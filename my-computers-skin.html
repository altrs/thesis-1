			<b>WRITING OUTLINE:</b><br><br>
			Topic: The material nature of technology<br>
			Where is the shame within the topic?:  In this case, the shame is where/how/what we decide to look away from.<br>
			How does it lead to control?: It leads to control over our environment, and unwarrented abuse of consumer 'trust,' replacing trust with dependency.

			<b>MAIN GAME INTERATION:</b><br><br>
			Hide and seek: Deconstruct 'myths'/manipulative-branding of tech production. Give specific examples: lithium fields, undersea cables, internet infrastructure, etc.
		</p></div>
		<div><p>
			<b>TAKEAWAY:</b><br><br>
			Think back to when the internet had a balanced relationship with users, pre-behavioral surplus times.

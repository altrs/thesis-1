			<b>WRITING OUTLINE:</b><br><br>
			Topic: Robots<br>
			Where is the shame within the topic?:  The shame both appears and doesn't appear within the decision making during the creation of Robots and how we aim to tailor our experiences with them through UI/UX.<br>
			How does it lead to control?: When we cannot control ourselves or the people around us, we attempt to make something we can control. It continues to feed the idea that we can control 'humans' as we create them to be whatever we want a the click of a button. It gives us an outlet to exert control humans.

			<b>MAIN GAME INTERATION:</b><br><br>
			Creator's hands POV. You adjust the creator character in order to adjust the creator's output. Puzzle like objective / 'Achievements' that pushes players to get the creator to create all vastly different types of outputs.

			<b>WRITING OUTLINE:</b><br><br>
			Topic: The hubris language surrounding technology<br>
			Where is the shame within the topic?:  In this case, the shame is absent from the speech in technology launches and promotion<br>
			How does it lead to control?: In this case, the shameless language being used practically declares authority off little basis. Shamelessness encourages/is tied to manipulation in this instance.
		</p></div>

			<b>MAIN GAME INTERATION:</b><br><br>
			This game takes place within a tech launch presentation. You can change the presentation slides which in turn affects the speaker, either adding to the shamelessness, or adding humility to the speech. A 'sabotage simulation.'
		</p></div>
		<div><p>
			<b>TAKEAWAY:</b><br><br>
			Examine what various authors such as Zuboff have said about the ways in which language has been used for manipulation tactics by big tech. And also address content moderation, and censorship conundrums within this section.

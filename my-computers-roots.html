			<b>WRITING OUTLINE:</b><br><br>
			Topic: Roots<br>
			Tying that all together: Shame is inherently within technology, because shame is a large aspect of society. Coming to terms with technology and its ties to personhood, and it’s overall reflective nature on a societal scale.<br> 
			“The exploitation here is the rendering of our lives as behavioral data for the sake of others’ improved control of us” (Zuboff).  <br>
			Personifying instruments and tools is something we’ve always done. Specifying the nuances of shame, as displayed in the first chapters.<br>
			Valleys of the internet, focusing on the ways shame is positively within the internet. What does it mean to make environments more positive? How does unshaming/shame-ifying help? Discussing benefits, what it is, and what it is not. <br>
			Conclusion about changing the digital world to change the physical world.
